# Simulating-Buffer-Manager-Strategies
The project is to simulate a buffer pool that can be used for simple Join/Selection queries on a few small tables. The buffer pool supports buffer manager strategies like LRU/MRU/CLOCK blocks. The main purpose of the project is to compare the performance of these buffer manager strategies in terms of the number of disk I/O operations required. By simulating different buffer manager strategies and analysing their performance, this project aims to provide insights into the most efficient way of managing buffers for small tables in a database system.
